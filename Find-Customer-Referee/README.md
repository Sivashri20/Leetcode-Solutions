Intuition

The task is to find the names of customers who are not referred by the customer with id = 2. In the Customer table, referrals are represented by the referee_id column, which links a customer to the id of another customer who referred them.

Key Insight: A customer meets the condition if their referee_id is:

Not equal to 2, or
NULL (indicating they are not referred by anyone).

Approach

Filter Rows Using the WHERE Clause:

Identify customers where referee_id is either:
!= 2 (not referred by customer with id = 2), or
IS NULL (not referred by anyone).
The logical operator OR combines these two conditions.
Select Relevant Columns:

Retrieve only the name column of the customers that satisfy the conditions.
