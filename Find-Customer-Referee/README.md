Intuition

The task is to find the names of customers who are not referred by the customer with id = 2. In the Customer table, referrals are represented by the referee_id column, which links a customer to the id of another customer who referred them.

Key Insight: A customer meets the condition if their referee_id is:

*Not equal to 2, or

*NULL (indicating they are not referred by anyone).

Approach

1.Filter Rows Using the WHERE Clause:

2.Identify customers where referee_id is either:

  *  = 2 (not referred by customer with id = 2), or
  
  *  IS NULL (not referred by anyone).
  
The logical operator OR combines these two conditions.

3.Select Relevant Columns

4.Retrieve only the name column of the customers that satisfy the conditions.
