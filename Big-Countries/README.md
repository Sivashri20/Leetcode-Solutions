The problem is about identifying "big countries" based on two criteria:

Area >= 3,000,000: Countries that are geographically large.
Population >= 25,000,000: Countries with a large population.
The query uses a filtering operation to select rows where either of these conditions is true. This involves scanning through each row in the World table and checking the conditions (area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000).

Filtering: The WHERE clause evaluates each row independently. A row is included in the result if either condition is met.
Projection: The query retrieves only the name, population, and area columns for the filtered rows.
